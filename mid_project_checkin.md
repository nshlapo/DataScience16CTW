* Did you accomplish your goals?  If not, what happened?

We did accomplish our goals. We created .csv files with lists of columns we could use in each dataset for the categories 'health', 'economics', and 'education'. We have implemented a clustering algorithm (Agglomerative Clustering) and have been able to use Spectral Embedding to vplot our data in 2-d space.

* What have you accomplished thus far in the project?  Make sure to provide pointers to any intermediate artifacts generated from your project.  These artifacts could be code, plots, data, etc.

We have done a lot of work to make our data usable. We have several helper functions that clean our data, that preprocesses it, that creating a cluster, and that visualizes countries in 2-d space relative to eachother. This is all shown in `collab.ipynb`

* What is the minimum viable product that you will have done by next Friday?  What are your stretch goals?

This project has pivoted toward a data visualization project. Our goal is to create compelling visuals to show people who the US is and isn't similar to. Our MVP is to have several compelling graphs of countries plotted on an x-y axis, and to create a poster out of it. Our stretch goal is to use our clustering and spectral embedding to actually create a map, where each country is shaded based on where it falls in a spectrum (such as education, health, or economic).
