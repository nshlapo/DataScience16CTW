# Change the World Project Proposal

## Who’s on the team?

Nur Shlapobersky and David Abrahams

## Project Idea

We would like to perform an unsupervised analysis of global countries in order to find similarities between them. The ultimate goal is to globally place the US and answer the question, “Who are we similar to?”

## MVP / Final Deliverable

Our MVP is to have perform an unsupervised classification of countries, and have an answer to our project question. We would also like to identify the features that make the US most like certain countries.

## Stretch Goal

As a stretch goal we would like to perform clustering visualizations about countries. We would also like to analyse global historical data to view global trends, and how the US’s trends compare to global trends.

##Changing the World

This project will create awareness for where the US lies globally on many key issues, such as healthcare, economics, and racial and gender equality.

##Learning Goals

Neither of us have any experience with unsupervised learning or clustering, so we would like to explore both the analysis and visualization tools in this field.

##Data

We are pulling our data from the World Bank database, and we will be looking specifically at the World Development Indicators dataset.

##Workflow and Schedule

We will be dividing work into separate iPython notebooks, and then copying necessary code into master notebooks.

## Midpoint Checkin

By the midpoint check-in, we want to have identified the variables of the dataset that we will be using, calculated some statistical measurements for our data set. We will have also begun learning about unsupervised learning.

## Final Assessment

For our final assessment, we will have demonstrated that we learned about and implemented an unsupervised learning algorithm. We should be assessed on our machine learning process, what we were able to learn from the dataset, and also the quality of our visual representations. We will create a poster that demonstrates both the machine learning we implemented, and our findings.
